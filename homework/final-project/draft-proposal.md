- What your proposed project is about
My project related to my M.A. thesis on the analysis and comparison of the three major Japanese newspapers:
Asahi, Yomiuri and Mainichi. I will be searching for the keyword Yasukuni Shrine (in Japanese) and scraping/analyzing the results. 
The Yasukuni Shrine has a controversial place in history because it is supposed to house the spirits of the 'war heroes'.
However, these 'war heroes' are basically considered 'war criminals' in other countries because of Japan's position during World War II. 
As a result, high level official visits to the shrine as well as protests often end up high profile and much reported. 
The political slant of a newspaper may also be observed through reports on the shrine as the shrine's history is deeply steeped in Japan's militarism (for or against).

- The data sources you anticipate accessing
In order to study news content related to Yasukuni Shrine, I will have to access the online newspaper databases which are readily available.
Asahi: http://database.asahi.com.ezproxy.stanford.edu/
Yomiuri: https://database.yomiuri.co.jp/rekishikan/
Mainichi: https://dbs.g-search.or.jp/aps/WSKR/

For each of them, I will be accessing news starting from 1986, as that is a cutoff year for the Yomiuri database and is the latest among the three newspapers. 
Because each database is expansive, I will be accessing only the major editions of the newspapers, and not the regional editions. 
As the news articles are updated everyday, I will probably set the cut-off date to be March 1, 2015.

A search with the keyword  shows 9000+ articles from the Asahi database, 4000+ from the Yomiuri database and 7000+ from the Mainichi database as of now. 
Without the ability to scrape the files automatically and analyze them using a program, the task would be rather insurmountable. 

- The general workings of the program you anticipate writing
1. Each of the research results have some idiosyncrasies in their layout, so I will have to slightly alter the way I am scraping search results from each of the databases.
